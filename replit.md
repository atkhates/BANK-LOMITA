# Discord Bank Bot

## Overview
A Discord bot that manages a virtual banking system with Arabic UI. Users can register accounts, transfer funds, check balances, and admins can manage accounts through a comprehensive admin panel.

## Project Details
- **Language**: Node.js (JavaScript)
- **Main Framework**: discord.js v14
- **Database**: File-based JSON storage
- **Language Support**: Arabic (UI and messages)

## Architecture

### How Everything Connects

The bot follows a modular architecture where **`index.js`** is the central orchestrator:

```
index.js (Main Hub)
├── Commands (./commands/*.js)
│   ├── register.js → Shows registration modal
│   ├── account.js → Displays user balance/info
│   ├── transfer.js → Handles money transfers
│   ├── withdraw.js → Processes withdrawals
│   ├── rank.js → Shows available ranks
│   ├── admin.js → Admin control panel
│   ├── reglist.js → Registration statistics
│   ├── setup.js → Per-guild configuration
│   └── support.js → Support ticket system
│
├── Configuration & Permissions
│   ├── guildConfig.js → Per-guild settings (multi-server support)
│   ├── guildConfigs.json → Stored guild configurations
│   ├── config.json → Default configuration template
│   └── permissions.json → Role-based permission mapping
│
├── Data Persistence
│   ├── database/users.json → User accounts & balances
│   └── database/transactions.json → Transaction history
│
└── Google Sheets Integration (Optional)
    └── sheets.js → Real-time sync with Google Sheets
```

### Core Files

**Main Entry Point:**
- `index.js` - Central orchestrator that:
  - Loads all command modules from `./commands/`
  - Handles all Discord interactions (slash commands, buttons, modals, select menus)
  - Provides helper functions to commands: `loadUsers()`, `saveUsers()`, `pushTx()`, `updateRegList()`, `pushLog()`
  - Enforces permissions using `hasPermission()` with data from `permissions.json`
  - Manages registration flow with multi-step modals and selects
  - Syncs data to Google Sheets (if configured)

**Configuration Management:**
- `guildConfig.js` - Per-guild configuration accessor
  - Exports: `get(guildId)`, `set(guildId, config)`, `patch(guildId, updates)`
  - Allows multi-server bot deployment with separate settings per server
  - Falls back to `config.json` defaults
- `permissions.json` - Role-based permissions for admin actions
  - Maps role IDs to permissions: approve, reject, addBalance, editInfo, editFee, etc.

**Data Layer:**
- `database/users.json` - User data storage (auto-created)
- `database/transactions.json` - Transaction log (auto-created)
- `sheets.js` - Optional Google Sheets integration
  - Safely wrapped: if unavailable, bot uses no-op methods
  - Syncs users and transactions in real-time
  - Auto-creates "Users" and "Transactions" sheets

**Command Registration:**
- `deploy-commands.js` - Registers slash commands with Discord API
  - Must be run when commands are added/modified
  - Supports both guild-specific (instant) and global deployment (1 hour)

### User Model
Each user record contains:
- Personal info: name, country, age, birth date
- Account info: balance, rank, status (pending/approved/rejected/blacklisted)
- Type info: kind (مدني/عصابة/فصيل), faction (for فصيل type)
- Freeze status and income

## Setup

### Required Secrets
The following environment variables are required:
- `TOKEN` - Discord bot token from Discord Developer Portal
- `CLIENT_ID` - Discord application client ID

### Configuration

Use the `/setup` command to configure all channels for your server:

**Required Channels:**
- `register_channel` - Channel where users can register accounts
- `review_channel` - Channel for admin review of registrations

**Optional Channels:**
- `reglist_channel` - Channel showing registration statistics summary
- `log_channel` - Channel for admin action logs (approvals, edits, etc.)
- `transaction_log_channel` - **NEW!** Channel for all financial transactions (transfers, withdrawals, deposits)
- `admin_role` - Role ID for administrators

**Transaction Log Features:**
The transaction log channel will automatically display:
- 💸 **User Transfers** - When users transfer money to each other
- 💰 **User Withdrawals** - When users withdraw from their accounts
- ➕ **Admin Deposits** - When admins add balance to accounts
- ➖ **Admin Withdrawals** - When admins withdraw from accounts

Each transaction log includes:
- User names and mentions
- Amount, fees, and totals
- Remaining balance
- Timestamp

**Other Configuration:**
- `CURRENCY_SYMBOL` - Currency symbol (default: $)
- `ranks` - Available account ranks
- `fees` - Transaction fees (deposit, transfer, withdraw)
- `MIN_DEPOSIT` - Minimum income requirement

Update `permissions.json` with your role IDs for various permissions.
